Abstract
Title of Masters thesis:
Integration of a generic microcontroller including analog and digital periphery
into a FPGA-based hardware-in-the-Loop simulation environment for power
electronics.

This master thesis is created in cooperation with Tridonic GmbH & Co KG.
The aim of this work is to use a generic microcontroller in an existing simulation
environment while taking into account the simulation clock, and implementing
the analog and digital peripherals such that a power electronics circuit can be
simulated.

In an FPGA-based hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment, the generic
microcontroller is integrated and tested together with a buck converter model.
With this experiment, statements are made as to how sensitive the system is to
the simulation clock, how well the modeled peripherals work, and with which
simulation speed such a simulation can be executed. An evaluation of the state
of the art reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the developed system.
